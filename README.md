## Contributing (and disclaimer)

This project is an undergraduate thesis project for bachelor degree on game technology major at Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya.

Unfortunately, I'm not focusing on data science things, for now.

I'm focusing on my full-stack developer role. 

But, if you want to consider contributing to this repository maybe I can review it as a hobby.

There is still some possibility for me to learn more about data science and develop this project.
